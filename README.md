# LeaseLabs Engineering Assessment
Thank you for taking the time to participate in this assessment! Below you'll find all of the information you should need to complete this assessment. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to us.

### What We're Interested In

* Architecture/techniques/design used to make calls (For the HTTP/REST API client library, can use HTTParty gem)
* Integrity of functionality
* Organization
* Proper error handling
* Structure that's scalable
* Code cleanliness
* Use of best practices
* Creativity

### Side Notes - For the purposes of this assessment
  - You are not subject to only what is asked. Add anything you need to make the solution more complete.
  - You do not necessarily need any additional external tools other than your rest API gem and testing gems (Rspec..etc)
  - No additional tables/migrations are needed.
  - You can write everything you need to, using Ruby.
  - There are no user logins needed for this assessment.
  - You do not have to focus on additional styling or additional javascript.
  - Assess and plan out your steps, this may save you some time.

## Project Tasks ##
### Install application in local environment:
  - Ruby: 2.5.1
  - Rails: 5.2.0

### Bundle
  bundle install

### Populate Database
  bundle exec rake db_tasks:rebuild

### What you currently have
  This is an application that was created by 2 scaffolds for categories and games. Through scaffolding and seeds, this application alone, is a simple working application that can edit and maintain a game inventory.

### Tasks
  General Description: create open-ended api functionality for an external application to connect to this application

### 1) Get the following curls working:
  - curl -G -d "" "http://gamelibrary.com:3000/v1/categories"
  - curl -G -d "" "http://gamelibrary.com:3000/v1/games"

### 2) Create an external app called "mygames"
  - Allow this external app to retrieve a list of games and categories from the base app
  - On the home page of mygames (http://mygames.com:3001), have it show a list of all category names. These will all be links that direct to their list of games.

### 3) Getting, Updating, Deleting on "mygames"
  - provide the ability to add/delete categories
  - provide the ability to add/update/delete games

### 4) On home page, create a search field that displays all found games with the given search tag
  ex: search_tag "bat" will find "Batman: Arkham City"
  ex: search_tag "dead" or "king" will find "The Walking Dead"
  - Create an option to select category while searching (will have default option "All Categories")

### 5) File downloads
  Next to each category on the categories index view page, create a button link click that will place all games for that category and their information into a csv file and wrap that up into a zip file.  Clicking on the download button will allow a zip file to be downloaded into the computer's ~/Downloads folder.

### Complete all 5 steps above having each feature operational

**NOTE:** For all 5 steps above, exhibit the various types of techniques, setup practices.. etc you would use to accomplish the goals. The completion of this goal can be achieved in many ways. Put foward your best effort. This assessment is meant to get an idea of how a backend engineer would choose to build this based on their experience. Some notes below:

  - Update the base app if needed. Make your external app well-rounded.
  - Think of things like "What if 50 different external apps would connect to the base app?" or "What if my external app connects to 50 different base apps?"

### Completion and Delivery
The above tasks requests you to clone this repo as it contains a skeleton for you to get started. All files and code to submit can exist within the 2 applications.  When complete, email a link to submissions@leaselabs.com. Please submit the following:

 - Your updated test-engineer app (this is the gamelibrary base app)
 - Your new mygames app

### This is how we'll run the apps:

Terminal 1:

  `git clone <your_base_app_repo>`
  `cd test-engineer`
  `bundle install`
  `rails s -p 3000`

Terminal 2:

  `git clone <your_external_app_repo>`
  `cd mygames`
  `bundle install`
  `rails s -p 3001`

On a web browser go to:

http://mygames.com:3001/

Upon verifying the functionality, we'll take a look at how you decided to build out the tasks and make the 2 apps, in your perspective, complete, with the time given.

**MIT License - Open Source** We have created this test as an assessment for backend-end developers. If anyone else finds this useful, it's available for you to use anyway you like.
