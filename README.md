### 2) Create an external app called "mygames"
  - Allow this app to retrieve a list of games and categories
  - On the home page of mygames (http://mygames.com:3001), have it show a list of all category names. These will all be links that direct to their list of games.

### 3) Getting, Updating, Deleting on "mygames"

  - Create an option to select category while searching (will have default option "All Categories")

### 5) File downloads
  On any list of games from a category link click, provide a button to place all games and their information into a txt or csv file and wrap that up into a zip file.  Clicking on the download button will allow a zip file to be downloaded into the ~/Downloads folder.
