  - Rails: 5.2.0

### Bundle
  bundle install

### Populate Database

### About
  This application alone, is a simple working application that can edit and maintain a game inventory

### Tasks
  General Description: create open-ended api functionality for an external application to connect to this application

### 1) Get the following curls working:
  - curl -G -d "" "http://gamelibrary.com:3000/v1/categories"
  - curl -G -d "" "http://gamelibrary.com:3000/v1/games"

### 2) Create an external app called "mygames"
  - Allow this app to retrieve a list of games and categories
  - On the home page of mygames (http://mygames.com:3001), have it show a list of all category names. These will all be links that direct to their list of games.

### 3) Getting, Updating, Deleting on "mygames"
  - provide the ability to add/delete categories
  - provide the ability to add/update/delete games

### 4) On home page, create a search field that displays all found games with the given search tag
  ex: search_tag "bat" will find "Batman: Arkham City"
  ex: search_tag "dead" or "king" will find "The Walking Dead"
  - Create an option to select category while searching (will have default option "All Categories")

### 5) File downloads
  Next to each category on the categories index view page, create a button link click that will place all games for that category and their information into a csv file and wrap that up into a zip file.  Clicking on the download button will allow a zip file to be downloaded into the computer's ~/Downloads folder.
